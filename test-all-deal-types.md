# Comprehensive Deal Type Routing Test Plan

## üéØ **Objective**
Verify that all three deal types (Simple, Clearinghouse, Valuation) properly route to their respective workflows and render correctly.

## üß™ **Test Setup**

### **Prerequisites:**
1. **Hard refresh** browser: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
2. **Open developer console** (F12)
3. **Clear console** before each test
4. **Ensure you're logged in** and on the dashboard

## üìã **Test Cases**

### **Test 1: Simple Deal Logging**
1. **Click "Get Started"** on "Simple Deal Logging" card
2. **Expected Console Logs:**
   ```
   [Dashboard] ===== STARTING DEAL CREATION FLOW =====
   [Dashboard] handleDealTypeSelect called with dealType: simple
   [DealContext] createDraftDeal called with dealType: simple
   [DealContext] Create deal API response status: 200
   [Dashboard] Routing to SIMPLE deal workflow
   [Dashboard] Navigating to: /add/deal/social-media/XXX?type=simple
   [DealWizardRoute] Component rendered with dealId: XXX
   [DealWizardRoute] currentDeal: {deal_type: 'simple', ...}
   [Step0_SocialMedia] ===== COMPONENT RENDERED =====
   [Step0_SocialMedia] dealType: simple
   ```
3. **Expected Result:** Social media form loads with "Simple Deal Logging" header

### **Test 2: NIL Go Clearinghouse Check**
1. **Click "Get Started"** on "NIL Go Clearinghouse Check" card
2. **Expected Console Logs:**
   ```
   [Dashboard] ===== STARTING DEAL CREATION FLOW =====
   [Dashboard] handleDealTypeSelect called with dealType: clearinghouse
   [DealContext] createDraftDeal called with dealType: clearinghouse
   [DealContext] Create deal API response status: 200
   [Dashboard] Routing to CLEARINGHOUSE deal workflow
   [Dashboard] Navigating to: /add/deal/social-media/XXX?type=clearinghouse
   [DealWizardRoute] Component rendered with dealId: XXX
   [DealWizardRoute] currentDeal: {deal_type: 'clearinghouse', ...}
   [Step0_SocialMedia] ===== COMPONENT RENDERED =====
   [Step0_SocialMedia] dealType: clearinghouse
   ```
3. **Expected Result:** Social media form loads with "NIL Go Clearinghouse Check" header

### **Test 3: Deal Valuation Analysis**
1. **Click "Get Started"** on "Deal Valuation Analysis" card
2. **Expected Console Logs:**
   ```
   [Dashboard] ===== STARTING DEAL CREATION FLOW =====
   [Dashboard] handleDealTypeSelect called with dealType: valuation
   [DealContext] createDraftDeal called with dealType: valuation
   [DealContext] Create deal API response status: 200
   [Dashboard] Routing to VALUATION deal workflow
   [Dashboard] Navigating to: /add/deal/social-media/XXX?type=valuation
   [DealWizardRoute] Component rendered with dealId: XXX
   [DealWizardRoute] currentDeal: {deal_type: 'valuation', ...}
   [Step0_SocialMedia] ===== COMPONENT RENDERED =====
   [Step0_SocialMedia] dealType: valuation
   ```
3. **Expected Result:** Social media form loads with "Deal Valuation Analysis" header

## üîç **What to Look For**

### **‚úÖ Success Indicators:**
- **No 405 errors** in console
- **No blank screens** - should see social media form
- **Correct deal type** in URL parameters
- **Proper headers** for each deal type
- **All console logs** appear in sequence

### **‚ùå Failure Indicators:**
- **405 "Method Not Allowed" errors** - backend issue
- **Blank screen** - routing/component issue
- **Missing console logs** - logging issue
- **Wrong deal type** in URL - routing issue

## üêõ **Debugging Steps**

### **If Test Fails:**
1. **Check console for errors** - look for 405, 401, or 500 errors
2. **Verify backend is running** - health check should return 200
3. **Check network tab** - look for failed API requests
4. **Clear browser cache** - try incognito mode
5. **Check URL parameters** - ensure deal type is correct

### **Common Issues:**
- **405 errors**: Backend endpoint not deployed
- **Blank screen**: Component not rendering due to missing data
- **Wrong deal type**: URL parameter not being passed correctly

## üìä **Expected Results Summary**

| Deal Type | URL Pattern | Expected Header | Status |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| Simple | `/add/deal/social-media/XXX?type=simple` | "Simple Deal Logging" | ‚úÖ |
| Clearinghouse | `/add/deal/social-media/XXX?type=clearinghouse` | "NIL Go Clearinghouse Check" | ‚úÖ |
| Valuation | `/add/deal/social-media/XXX?type=valuation` | "Deal Valuation Analysis" | ‚úÖ |

## üöÄ **Deployment Status**
- ‚úÖ **Frontend fixes deployed**
- ‚úÖ **Backend GET endpoint deployed**
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive logging added**
- ‚úÖ **currentDeal state implemented**

**Ready for testing!**
