## JSONB Field Structures

### `deals.activities` JSONB Structure (Array)

[
  {
    "type": "social_media",
    "platforms": ["instagram", "twitter", "tiktok"],

## Relationships

```
auth.users --< profiles --< deals
profiles --> schools
```

**Key Relationship Notes:**
- **One-to-many:** Each profile (athlete) can have multiple deals
- **Single-sided:** Deals are athlete-centric (no direct brand profile link)
- **School Association:** Profiles linked to schools via integer ID

## Common Query Patterns

### 1. Get Athlete Profile with School Info
```sql
SELECT p.*, s.name as school_name, s.division
FROM profiles p
LEFT JOIN schools s ON p.school_id = s.id
WHERE p.id = $1 AND p.role = 'athlete';
```

### 2. Get All Deals for an Athlete
```sql
SELECT d.*, p.full_name as athlete_name
FROM deals d
JOIN profiles p ON d.user_id = p.id
WHERE d.user_id = $1
ORDER BY d.created_at DESC;
```

### 3. Get Deals by Status
```sql
SELECT d.*, p.full_name as athlete_name, p.university
FROM deals d
JOIN profiles p ON d.user_id = p.id
WHERE d.status = $1
ORDER BY d.created_at DESC;
```

### 4. Search Schools by Division
```sql
SELECT * FROM schools 
WHERE division = $1 
  AND name ILIKE '%' || $2 || '%'
ORDER BY name;
```

### 5. Get Deal Financial Summary
```sql
SELECT 
  d.id,
  d.deal_nickname,
  d.compensation_cash,
  d.fmv,
  d.compensation_goods,
  d.compensation_other,
  p.full_name as athlete_name
FROM deals d
JOIN profiles p ON d.user_id = p.id
WHERE d.status = 'approved'
ORDER BY d.compensation_cash DESC NULLS LAST;
```

## Business Rules & Validation

### Profile Validation
- **Athletes:** Should have school_id, sports[], division, and gender
- **All Users:** Must have full_name and role
- **Contact Info:** Email and phone for communication

### Deal Validation
- **Status Flow:** draft ‚Üí submitted ‚Üí approved/rejected
- **Required Fields:** user_id, deal_nickname, at least one form of compensation
- **File Uploads:** deal_terms files must be approved formats (pdf, docx, png, jpg, jpeg)
- **Compensation:** Must have either cash, goods, or other compensation specified
- **Activities:** Must have at least one activity selected

### Deal Status Meanings
- **draft:** Deal being created/edited by athlete
- **submitted:** Deal submitted for review
- **approved:** Deal approved and active
- **rejected:** Deal rejected and inactive

## Performance Considerations

### Indexes
- `profiles.id` - Primary key (UUID)
- `profiles.role` - For user type filtering
- `profiles.school_id` - Foreign key index
- `deals.user_id` - Foreign key index (most important for queries)
- `deals.status` - For status-based filtering
- `deals.created_at` - For chronological ordering
- `schools.name` - For school search
- `schools.division` - For division filtering

### JSONB Optimization
- Use GIN indexes on JSONB fields for complex queries
- Query specific JSONB keys using `->` and `->>`
- Consider extracted computed columns for frequently queried JSONB properties

## Migration History

| Migration | Description | Key Changes |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| 000 | Initial setup | Basic table structure |
| 001 | Schema updates | Added profile fields |
| 002 | Schema cleanup | Removed unused fields |
| 003 | Profile trigger | Auto-update timestamps |
| 004 | Profile fields | Added sports, division, gender |
| 005 | Sports field update | Modified sports array structure |
| 006 | Contact fields | Added phone number support |
| 007 | Schools table | Added NCAA schools support |
| 008-011 | School data | Populated schools in batches |
| 012 | Complete schools | Added NAIA/JUCO + remaining schools |

## Authentication Integration

### Supabase Auth Flow
1. User signs up via Supabase Auth
2. Profile record created with matching UUID
3. Profile.id matches auth.users.id exactly
4. Role-based access control via profiles.role

### RLS (Row Level Security)
- **Profiles:** Users can only read/update their own profile
- **Deals:** Athletes can only access their own deals (deals.user_id = auth.uid())
- **Schools:** Public read access for all users

## API Integration Notes

### FastAPI Endpoints
- **Profile Management:** `/api/profile/` routes in `backend/app/api/profile.py`
- **Deal Management:** `/api/deals/` routes in `backend/app/api/deals.py`
- **School Data:** For university suggestions and athlete profiles

### Frontend Integration
- **Supabase Client:** Configured in `frontend/src/supabaseClient.js`
- **Auth Context:** Managed via `frontend/src/context/AuthContext.jsx`
- **Deal Context:** State management via `frontend/src/context/DealContext.jsx`

## Data Sensitivity & Security

### Sensitive Data Fields
- **Personal Information:** full_name, email, phone in profiles
- **Financial Data:** compensation_cash, fmv, compensation details in deals
- **Contact Information:** payor contact details in deals
- **File Uploads:** deal_terms documents

### Security Measures
- **Environment Variables:** Database credentials via Supabase environment
- **Input Validation:** Pydantic models for API validation
- **File Upload Security:** Restricted file types and size limits
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth integration with JWT tokens
- **Data Encryption:** Handled by Supabase PostgreSQL encryption at rest

## Key Differences from Standard Multi-Party Deal Systems

### Single-User Deal Model
- **Athlete-Centric:** Deals are owned by athletes (`user_id` ‚Üí profiles)
- **Brand Information:** Stored as text fields in deal record (payor_name, contact_*)
- **Simplified Workflow:** Athlete creates deal, submits for approval
- **No Brand Profiles:** Brands don't have separate profile records in this model

### File Management
- **Deal Terms:** Uploaded documents with filename, type, and size tracking
- **Supported Formats:** PDF, DOCX, PNG, JPG, JPEG
- **File Metadata:** Stored in deal record, actual files in Supabase Storage

## Recent Major Database Updates

### December 2024 - Complete Schools Database Implementation

**Changes Made:**
1. **Extended ncaa_division Enum:**
   - Added 'NAIA' and 'JUCO' values to existing enum ('I', 'II', 'III')
   - Required separate transaction due to PostgreSQL enum constraints

2. **Massive School Data Addition:**
   - **~200+ Division I schools** added to complete NCAA Division I coverage
   - **~127 Division II schools** added for comprehensive D-II coverage
   - **~86 Division III schools** added for major D-III institutions
   - **~71 NAIA schools** added for NAIA coverage
   - **~101 JUCO schools** added for community college coverage

3. **Database Impact:**
   - **Total Schools:** 710 institutions across all divisions
   - **Division I:** 325 schools (near-complete NCAA D-I coverage)
   - **Major Conferences:** All Power 5 and major mid-major conferences included
   - **Geographic Coverage:** Schools from all 50 states and territories

**Business Impact:**
- **University Suggestions:** SignUp and EditProfile now have comprehensive institution coverage
- **Athlete Profiles:** All collegiate levels supported for complete NIL ecosystem
- **Professional Credibility:** Database matches industry standards for collegiate athletics

**Technical Notes:**
- Used `ON CONFLICT (name) DO NOTHING` to prevent duplicate entries
- Enum values committed in separate transaction before school insertions
- No breaking changes to existing application code
- All existing school_id references remain valid
