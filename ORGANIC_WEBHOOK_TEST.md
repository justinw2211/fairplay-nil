# Organic Webhook Integration Test

This PR contains a test page to verify the complete end-to-end Sentry webhook integration.

## Test Page: /webhook-test

Visit this page on the preview deployment to trigger a real error and verify:
- Sentry captures the error with commit SHA
- Webhook fires automatically
- PR comment is created/updated automatically

## Expected Flow

1. Click "Trigger Test Error" button
2. Real JavaScript error is thrown
3. Sentry receives error with commit SHA
4. Sentry webhook fires
5. Sticky comment appears on this PR automatically

This proves the entire automatic error monitoring system works!
