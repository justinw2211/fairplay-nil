# Deal Type Architecture Analysis

## Overview

The FairPlay NIL platform supports three distinct deal types, each providing different user experiences and analysis capabilities for student-athletes:

1. **Simple Deal Logging** - Basic deal tracking without predictive analysis
2. **NIL Go Clearinghouse Check** - Prediction on clearinghouse approval likelihood  
3. **Deal Valuation Analysis** - Fair market value compensation ranges

## Architecture Comparison

### Common Components

All three deal types share the same core wizard steps:

- **Step 0**: Social Media Collection (`Step0_SocialMedia.jsx`)
- **Step 1**: Deal Terms (`Step1_DealTerms.jsx`) 
- **Step 2**: Payor Information (`Step2_PayorInfo.jsx`)
- **Step 3**: Activity Selection (`Step3_SelectActivities.jsx`)
- **Step 5**: Compliance (`Step5_Compliance.jsx`)
- **Step 6**: Compensation (`Step6_Compensation.jsx`)
- **Step 8**: Review (`Step8_Review.jsx`)

### Deal Type Selection

**Location**: `DealTypeSelection.jsx` and `Dashboard.jsx`

**Selection Options**:
```javascript
const dealTypes = [
  {
    id: 'simple',
    title: 'Simple Deal Logging',
    description: 'Basic deal tracking without predictive analysis. Perfect for straightforward deals where you just need status management.',
    icon: FiFileText
  },
  {
    id: 'clearinghouse', 
    title: 'NIL Go Clearinghouse Check',
    description: 'Get a prediction on whether your deal will be approved, denied, or flagged by the NIL Go Clearinghouse.',
    icon: FiShield

    icon: FiTrendingUp
  }
];
```
