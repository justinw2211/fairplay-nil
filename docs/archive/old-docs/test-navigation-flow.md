# Website Navigation Flow Test Plan

> **⚠️ OUTDATED DOCUMENTATION**  
> This document is archived and reflects an older implementation. The current navigation flow and API endpoints are implemented differently. See `docs/features/deal-wizard/three-deal-form-routing.md` for current architecture.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### ✅ **Primary Issue: Missing Backend API Endpoint**
- **Problem**: Frontend was making GET requests to `/api/deals/{dealId}` but backend only had POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoints
- **Solution**: Added missing GET endpoint for individual deals in `backend/app/api/deals.py`
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed and deployed

### ✅ **Secondary Issue: Deal Creation Parameter**
- **Problem**: Dashboard was passing deal type as object `{deal_type: dealType}` instead of string
- **Solution**: Fixed parameter passing in `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx`
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed and deployed

## Comprehensive Test Flow

### 1. **Authentication Flow**
- [ ] User can sign up
- [ ] User can log in
- [ ] User can log out
- [ ] Protected routes redirect to login when not authenticated

### 2. **Dashboard Navigation**
- [ ] Dashboard loads without errors
- [ ] Profile banner displays correctly
- [ ] Summary cards show correct data
- [ ] Social media followers display properly
- [ ] No progress bars under "completed deals" (as requested)

### 3. **Deal Creation Flow**
- [ ] "Create New Deal" buttons work without errors
- [ ] No "Method Not Allowed" (405) errors in console
- [ ] No "Invalid deal type" errors
- [ ] User is redirected to deal wizard after creation

### 4. **Deal Wizard Navigation**
- [ ] Step0_SocialMedia loads correctly
- [ ] DealWizardRoute component works
- [ ] Deal data is fetched successfully
- [ ] Navigation between steps works
- [ ] Error boundaries catch and handle errors gracefully

### 5. **API Endpoint Verification**
- [ ] GET `/api/deals` - List all deals ✅
- [ ] POST `/api/deals` - Create new deal ✅
- [ ] GET `/api/deals/{dealId}` - Get individual deal ✅ (NEW)
- [ ] PUT `/api/deals/{dealId}` - Update deal ✅
- [ ] DELETE `/api/deals/{dealId}` - Delete deal ✅

### 6. **Error Handling**
- [ ] Network errors are handled gracefully
- [ ] Backend unavailable shows appropriate message
- [ ] Invalid deal types show proper error
- [ ] Authentication errors redirect to login

### 7. **UI/UX Verification**
- [ ] Dark banner background displays correctly
- [ ] Contact button is more subtle than Edit Profile
- [ ] No green "COMPLETE" button in banner
- [ ] Social media followers card shows total and platforms
- [ ] Progress bars removed from Active Deals card

## Test Steps for User

### **Step 1: Verify Dashboard**
1. Navigate to dashboard
2. Check that all summary cards load without errors
3. Verify dark banner background
4. Confirm contact button styling

### **Step 2: Test Deal Creation**
1. Click any "Create New Deal" button
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify navigation to deal wizard
4. Confirm deal data loads in wizard

### **Step 3: Test Deal Wizard**
1. Navigate through deal wizard steps
2. Check for any console errors
3. Verify data persistence between steps
4. Test error recovery if issues occur

### **Step 4: Test Error Scenarios**
1. Disconnect network and try to create deal
2. Check error messages are user-friendly
3. Verify recovery mechanisms work

## Expected Results

### ✅ **Should Work Now:**
- Deal creation buttons should work without errors
- No more "Method Not Allowed" (405) errors
- Proper navigation to deal wizard
- All API endpoints accessible

### ⚠️ **Potential Remaining Issues:**
- Backend deployment may need time to update
- Environment variables may need to be set
- Network connectivity to backend API

## Debugging Commands

### Check Backend Status:
```bash
curl -X GET https://fairplay-nil-backend.onrender.com/api/deals/1
```

### Check Frontend Build:
```bash
cd frontend && npm run build
```

### Check API Endpoints:
```bash
# Test individual deal endpoint
curl -X GET https://fairplay-nil-backend.onrender.com/api/deals/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test the fix**: Try creating a new deal
2. **Monitor console**: Check for any remaining errors
3. **Verify navigation**: Ensure proper flow through wizard
4. **Report results**: Let me know if any issues persist

The main issue (missing GET endpoint) has been fixed and deployed. The deal creation should now work properly!
