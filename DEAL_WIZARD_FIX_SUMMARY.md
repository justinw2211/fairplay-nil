# Deal Wizard Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
Users were getting stuck on a loading screen after completing the "select activities" page instead of routing correctly to the activity forms.

## Root Cause
The issue was a state synchronization problem between `DealWizardRoute` and `ActivityRouter` components:

1. `DealWizardRoute` successfully fetches the deal and has it available as `currentDeal`
2. `ActivityRouter` was trying to fetch the deal again even when it was already available
3. Components were inconsistently using `deal` vs `currentDeal` from the `useDeal()` hook
4. The `updateDeal` function wasn't properly updating the `currentDeal` state due to type mismatches in ID comparison

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated ActivityRouter to use currentDeal consistently
- Changed from `const { deal, loading, fetchDealById, updateDeal } = useDeal();` to `const { currentDeal, loading, fetchDealById, updateDeal } = useDeal();`
- Added better logic to only fetch deal if it doesn't exist or if the deal ID doesn't match
- Added detailed logging to track state synchronization

### 2. Fixed DealContext state updates
- Fixed type comparison issues in `updateDeal` function by using `parseInt(dealId)` for consistent ID comparison
- Added better logging to track when `currentDeal` state is being updated
- Added backward compatibility by providing both `currentDeal` and `deal` properties

### 3. Updated critical components
- Updated `Step3_SelectActivities` to use `currentDeal` instead of `deal`
- Updated `ActivityForm_SocialMedia` to use `currentDeal` instead of `deal`
- Updated `Step2_PayorInfo` to use `currentDeal` instead of `deal`
- Updated `Step1_DealTerms` to use `currentDeal` instead of `deal`

### 4. Enhanced logging and debugging
- Added comprehensive Sentry tracking throughout the flow
- Added detailed console logging to track state changes
- Added logging for deal fetching, state updates, and component initialization

## Expected Result
- Users should no longer get stuck on loading screens after completing the "select activities" page
- The activity forms should load properly with the correct deal data and obligations
- State synchronization between components should be consistent
- Better error tracking and debugging capabilities

## Testing
The fix addresses the core issue where `ActivityRouter` was showing `deal: undefined` and `activitySequence: â–¸ Array(0)` even though `DealWizardRoute` had successfully fetched the deal data. The state synchronization should now work correctly.
