# Coding workflow preferences

* Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
* Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
* Write thorough tests for all major functionality
* Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed
* Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
*Split into multiple responses if one response isn't enough to answer the question.

## Testing Preferences

* Default to Jest + React Testing Library for unit/integration tests
* Use Playwright only for reference flows on Chrome against production
* Write tests for new components, hooks, utilities
* Test business logic and data transformations
* Use test utilities from `frontend/src/utils/test-utils.js`
