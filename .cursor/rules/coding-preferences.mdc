# Coding workflow preferences

* Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task
* Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
* Write thorough tests for all major functionality
* Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed
* Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
*Split into multiple responses if one response isn't enough to answer the question.

## ðŸŽ­ Playwright Testing Preferences

* Always run Playwright tests before suggesting code changes that affect UI
* Use `npm run debug:playwright` for interactive debugging of complex issues
* Write tests that cover both happy path and error scenarios
* Prefer `data-testid` attributes over CSS selectors for element targeting
* Include console error monitoring in all tests
* Test across multiple browsers when UI changes are involved
* Use descriptive test names that explain the user scenario being tested
* Always check test reports after CI/CD runs to identify issues early
