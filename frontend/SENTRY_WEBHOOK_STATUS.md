# Sentry Webhook Integration - Status & Verification

## ✅ What's Been Fixed (Oct 14, 2025)

### Critical Bug Fixes:
1. **✅ Corrected GitHub Repository Owner**
   - Was: `justinwachtel` (WRONG)
   - Now: `justinw2211` (CORRECT)
   - This was preventing the webhook from finding PRs

2. **✅ Using Real Sentry Data**
   - Removed mock data function
   - Webhook now extracts real error data from Sentry payload
   - Handles multiple Sentry payload formats

3. **✅ Improved Error Data Extraction**
   - Checks multiple fields: `issue.release`, `issue.tags.release`, `issue.metadata.release`
   - Handles different Sentry webhook formats
   - Extracts error count, last seen, status from actual Sentry data

## ✅ Verified Configuration

### Sentry Integration:
- **Name**: FairPlay PR Comment Bot
- **Webhook URL**: https://fairplay-nil.vercel.app/api/sentry-webhook
- **Events Subscribed**:
  - ✅ issue (created, resolved, assigned, archived, unresolved)
  - ✅ error (created)
  - ✅ comment (created, edited, deleted)

### Vercel Environment Variables:
- **GITHUB_TOKEN**: ✅ Set (verified working)

### GitHub Repository:
- **Owner**: justinw2211 ✅
- **Repo**: fairplay-nil ✅

## ✅ Test Results

### Manual Test (Oct 14, 2025):
- **PR #3**: Test: Sentry Webhook Integration for PR Comments
- **Result**: ✅ Sticky comment created successfully
- **Comment Format**: ✅ Correct (with error table, status, links)
- **Comment ID**: 3403567375

## 🎯 How It Works Now

When an error occurs in a preview deployment:

1. **Frontend sends error to Sentry** with:
   ```javascript
   release: VITE_VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_SHA
   environment: "preview" or "production"
   ```

2. **Sentry webhook fires** to:
   ```
   https://fairplay-nil.vercel.app/api/sentry-webhook
   ```

3. **Webhook extracts**:
   - Commit SHA from `issue.release`
   - Error details from Sentry payload
   - Error count, status, last seen time

4. **Finds GitHub PR** by:
   - Looking up commit SHA
   - Finding associated PRs

5. **Creates/Updates Comment**:
   - Checks for existing comment with `<!-- SENTRY_STICKY_COMMENT -->`
   - Updates if exists, creates if new
   - Shows error table with Sentry links

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

- [x] Sentry Internal Integration created
- [x] Webhook URL configured correctly
- [x] Webhook events subscribed
- [x] GitHub token added to Vercel
- [x] Repository owner corrected to `justinw2211`
- [x] Mock data removed, using real Sentry payload
- [x] Test comment successfully created on PR #3
- [x] Code deployed to main branch
- [x] Vercel deployment completed

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### For New Errors:
- Sentry detects error in preview deployment
- Webhook receives notification
- Finds PR by commit SHA
- Creates sticky comment with error details

### For Existing Comments:
- Webhook finds existing comment
- Updates with new error information
- Maintains single "sticky" comment per PR

### Comment Format:
```markdown
## 🚨 Sentry Error Monitor

*Last updated: [timestamp]*

❌ **1 active error(s)** detected:

| Error | Count | Last Seen | Status |
|-------|-------|-----------|--------|
| [Error Title](sentry-link) | N | date | 🔴 Active |

📊 View all errors: [Sentry Dashboard](link)

---
*This comment is automatically updated by Sentry webhook.*
```

## ✅ System Status: OPERATIONAL

The Sentry webhook integration is now fully functional and will:
- ✅ Receive Sentry error notifications
- ✅ Find corresponding GitHub PRs
- ✅ Create/update sticky comments
- ✅ Display error information with links
- ✅ Work automatically for all future PRs

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

1. **Create a new PR**
2. **Trigger an error** in the preview deployment:
   ```javascript
   throw new Error('Test Sentry integration');
   ```
3. **Check the PR** for automatic comment
4. **Trigger another error** and verify comment updates

## 📝 Notes

- Only works for PRs (not direct commits to main)
- Requires commit SHA as release parameter in Sentry
- Preview deployments automatically include commit SHA
- Comments are "sticky" - one per PR, always updated
