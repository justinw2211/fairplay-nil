# Playwright Testing Summary

## 🎯 Mission
Use Playwright to determine the differences between user experiences in each of the three deal forms (simple, clearinghouse, valuation) and ensure the UX is not broken.

## ✅ What We've Accomplished

### 1. Environment Setup
- ✅ Configured Playwright to work with production environment
- ✅ Set up authentication with test account (`test1@test.edu` / `testuser`)
- ✅ Resolved local development authentication issues (401 errors)
- ✅ Created global setup for authenticated tests

### 2. Navigation Flow Discovery
- ✅ Confirmed correct entry point: Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
- ✅ Identified deal type selection: "Get Started" buttons within cards
- ✅ Mapped URL patterns for each step
- ✅ Documented navigation patterns and button locations

### 3. Step-by-Step Testing
- ✅ **Step 1 - Social Media**: Fully working
  - URL: `/add/deal/social-media/{dealId}?type={dealType}`
  - Fields: Instagram handle/followers, TikTok handle/followers
  - Navigation: "Continue >" button works correctly
  - Test data: `@testuser`/`1000`, `@testuser_tiktok`/`500`

- 🔄 **Step 2 - Deal Terms**: Partially tested
  - URL: `/add/deal/terms/{dealId}?type={dealType}`
  - Fields: File upload + text input for deal nickname
  - Issue: Green popup covers Continue button
  - Status: Popup handling code added, needs testing

### 4. Documentation & Organization
- ✅ Created comprehensive findings documentation
- ✅ Organized test files and screenshots
- ✅ Documented known issues and solutions
- ✅ Created context file for easy pickup

## 🔄 What's Next

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Test Deal Terms Popup Fix**: Run the updated test to see if popup dismissal works
2. **Complete Step-by-Step Testing**: Test remaining steps (Payor Info, Activities, Compliance, Compensation)
3. **Build Complete Workflows**: Create end-to-end tests for all three deal types

### Remaining Steps to Test
- **Step 3**: Payor Info (`/add/deal/payor-info/{dealId}?type={dealType}`)
- **Step 4**: Activities (`/add/deal/activities/{dealId}?type={dealType}`)
- **Step 5**: Compliance (`/add/deal/compliance/{dealId}?type={dealType}`)
- **Step 6**: Compensation (`/add/deal/compensation/{dealId}?type={dealType}`)
- **Step 7**: Review/Submission

### Deal Type Differences to Document
- **Simple**: Basic deal tracking without predictive analysis
- **Clearinghouse**: Includes NIL Go clearinghouse prediction
- **Valuation**: Includes fair market value analysis

```

## 🎯 Success Criteria
- [ ] All three deal types can be completed end-to-end
- [ ] UX differences between deal types are documented
- [ ] Error scenarios are handled gracefully
- [ ] Tests are reliable and don't get interrupted

## 💡 Key Learnings
- Production environment works reliably for testing
- Social Media step is fully functional
- Deal Terms step has popup that needs handling
- One-step-at-a-time approach is most effective
- Screenshots are crucial for debugging
