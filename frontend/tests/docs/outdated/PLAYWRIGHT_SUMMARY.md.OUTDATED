- Complete end-to-end flow testing
- Backend startup handling with proper wait times

### ‚úÖ **Element Selection Strategies**
- Chakra UI compatible selectors (`text="Label"` instead of `input[value="value"]`)
- Dynamic placeholder handling (`input[placeholder*="Nike"], input[placeholder*="John"]`)
- Robust button selection with `.last()` and `.first()` methods
- Icon-based selection for plus/minus buttons

### ‚úÖ **Navigation Flow**

## üîß **TECHNICAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS**

### **Robust Test Infrastructure**
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Working patterns we've established:
- Production URL navigation with login fallback
- Chakra UI element selection strategies
- Dynamic form validation handling
- Comprehensive logging and debugging
- Screenshot capture for visual debugging
```

### **Element Selection Patterns**
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Working selectors:
page.locator('text="Business"').first()  // Radio buttons
page.locator('input[placeholder*="Nike"], input[placeholder*="John"]')  // Dynamic placeholders
page.locator('button:has-text("Next")').last()  // Button selection
page.locator('text="No"')  // Multiple option selection
```

### **Form Validation Handling**
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Working validation patterns:
- Wait for form elements to be visible
- Check button enabled state before clicking
- Handle dynamic UI changes
- Provide fallback mechanisms
```
