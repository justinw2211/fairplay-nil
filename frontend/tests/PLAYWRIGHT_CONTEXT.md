# Playwright Testing Context

## Current Status (January 2025)

### ✅ Completed Work
1. **Authentication Setup**: Successfully configured Playwright to work with production environment
   - Test account: `test1@test.edu` / `testuser`
   - Production URL: `https://fairplay-nil.vercel.app`
   - Global setup working in `global-setup.js`

2. **Deal Type Selection**: Confirmed correct navigation flow
   - Entry point: Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
   - Deal types: Simple, Clearinghouse, Valuation
   - Interaction: "Get Started" buttons within cards

3. **Step 1 - Social Media**: Fully tested and working
   - URL: `/add/deal/social-media/{dealId}?type={dealType}`
   - Required fields: Instagram handle/followers, TikTok handle/followers
   - Navigation: "Continue >" button works correctly
   - Test data: `@testuser`/`1000`, `@testuser_tiktok`/`500`

4. **Step 2 - Deal Terms**: Partially tested
   - URL: `/add/deal/terms/{dealId}?type={dealType}`
   - Form elements: File upload + text input
   - Issue: Green popup covers Continue button
   - Status: Popup handling code added but needs testing

### 🔄 In Progress
- **Deal Terms Step**: Need to test popup dismissal and continue button
- **Remaining Steps**: Payor Info, Activities, Compliance, Compensation, Review

### 📁 File Organization
```

├── deal-type-diagnostic.spec.js     # Individual step testing
├── deal-type-comparison.spec.js     # Complete workflow testing  
├── PLAYWRIGHT_FINDINGS.md           # Detailed findings documentation

    └── deal-type-diagnostic-*/      # Test run results
```

### 🎯 Next Steps (When Resuming)
1. **Fix Deal Terms Popup**: Test the popup dismissal code
2. **Complete Step-by-Step Testing**: Test each remaining step individually
3. **Build Complete Workflows**: Create tests for all three deal types
4. **UX Comparison**: Document differences between deal type experiences
5. **Error Handling**: Test edge cases and validation errors

### 🔧 Technical Notes
- **Environment**: Use production URLs to avoid local auth issues
- **Strategy**: Test one step at a time, document findings
- **Screenshots**: Capture each step for debugging
- **Navigation**: Look for "Continue" buttons in bottom right
- **Validation**: Check for disabled buttons and error messages

### 📋 Test Commands
```bash
# Run individual diagnostic tests
npm run test:e2e:auth -- --grep "should fill social media and click continue"
npm run test:e2e:auth -- --grep "should explore deal terms step"

# Run all tests
npm run test:e2e:auth

# View reports
npx playwright show-report
```

### 🐛 Known Issues
1. **Local Development**: 401 authentication errors with local backend
2. **Deal Terms Popup**: Green popup covers Continue button
3. **File Upload**: Deal Terms step has file upload that may be required
4. **Test Interruptions**: Some tests get interrupted during execution

### 💡 Key Learnings
- Production environment works reliably for testing
- Social Media step is fully functional
- Deal Terms step has popup that needs handling
- One-step-at-a-time approach is most effective
- Screenshots are crucial for debugging

### 🎯 Success Criteria
- [ ] All three deal types can be completed end-to-end
- [ ] UX differences between deal types are documented
- [ ] Error scenarios are handled gracefully
- [ ] Tests are reliable and don't get interrupted
